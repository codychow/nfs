//// My own rating on the functionality ///////////////////
Rating: B
Explanation: Most of the NFS functions work correctly and as expected.
The main issues stem from the append function and namesharing between
a file and directory in the same directory. Append is only able to append
text without spaces or /n. Additionally, the function responsible for
parsing a command allows text under ~4000 characters to appended at a time.
Namesharing is possible for a file and directory, but the user is only able
to use create/mkdir and rm/rmdir on the nameshared file and directory.
